## [Libassuan](https://gnupg.org/software/libassuan/index.html) bindings for Rust.
Libassuan is a small library implementing the so-called Assuan protocol. This protocol is used for IPC between most newer GnuPG components. This is a work in progress and currently, there are only a few client functions implemented.


## Build Requirements
This crate requires the libassuan C library and header files to be installed.

## Examples
A selection of examples can be found in [examples](./examples).
